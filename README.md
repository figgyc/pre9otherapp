# Pre 9.0 Otherapp
basically just to port soundhax to older versions to remove the need for mset and whatever

## how
`make` will output p9a11.bin and pre9otherapp.bin. rename pre9otherapp.bin to otherapp.bin (or whatever entrypoint requires), and move both to sd card. then find an a9lh/safehaxpayload style .bin (eg safeb9sinstaller), rename to p9a9.bin and drop on sd.

## creds
this is just a mishmash of other peoples code and they are the real mvps
* @smealum for ninjhax2.x original otherapp and udsploit
* @tinivi safehax
